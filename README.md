# Optimising Inter-Machine Communication using AI

## 1. Introduction

In modern distributed systems, ensuring secure, reliable, and scalable machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is criticalâ€”especially in environments where real-time performance monitoring and automated decision-making are essential.

This project presents a comprehensive system that integrates:

- Secure communication using gRPC with mutual TLS (mTLS) and JWT with JWKS
- Real-time monitoring and observability via Prometheus and Grafana
- Scalable containerized deployment using Minikube
- Latency and throughput modeling
- Automated anomaly detection
- Security threat mitigation

By combining secure communication protocols, intelligent monitoring, and proactive analytics, this system enables safe, scalable, and resilient inter-machine communication in distributed environments.

## 2. Secure Communication (mTLS, gRPC, JWKS)

Secure machine-to-machine communication is established through:

- **gRPC**: For fast and efficient communication between services.
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: For encrypted transport and mutual authentication between client and server.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For stateless authentication and role-based access control.
- **JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)**: For dynamic and secure public key distribution to validate JWTs.

This ensures both the confidentiality and authenticity of all inter-service communication.

## 3. Monitoring and Deployment (Prometheus, Grafana, Minikube)

The system includes an observability stack and is deployed using a simulated Kubernetes environment:

- **Minikube**: Used to locally simulate a Kubernetes cluster for scalable deployment.
- **Prometheus**: Continuously scrapes and stores system/application metrics.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes real-time data using dashboards.

### Monitored Metrics:

- Latency (ms)
- Packet Loss (%)
- Data Rate (Mbps)
- CPU and Memory Usage (%)
- Network Throughput (Bytes)
- Connection Status
- Source and Destination IPs

This allows deep visibility into the health and behavior of the system.

## 4. Latency and Throughput Modeling

The system collects communication metrics and models patterns of latency and throughput under various operational conditions.

This modeling supports:

- Understanding system performance trends
- Predicting potential bottlenecks
- Improving responsiveness and scalability

The metrics are collected from live gRPC communication and stored in structured formats for analysis.

## 5. Anomaly Detection

The architecture includes a module to automatically detect anomalies in system behavior using communication metrics.

Types of anomalies detected include:

- Sudden spikes in latency
- High packet loss
- Unexpected drops in data rate
- Combined network anomalies

Anomalies are flagged in real time and visualized via Grafana for faster response and debugging.

## 6. Security Attacks and Threats

The system is designed with a strong security posture to guard against common attack vectors.

### 6.1 IP Spoofing Attacks

- Attackers may attempt to impersonate trusted machines by falsifying IP headers.
- This is mitigated through mutual TLS, which verifies certificates at both ends.

### 6.2 DDoS Attacks and Data Integrity Attacks

- **DDoS Attacks** aim to exhaust system resources via high-volume traffic.
- **Data Integrity Attacks** attempt to modify or tamper with data in transit.

Both are addressed through layered security mechanisms and encrypted communication channels.

## 7. Strategies to Mitigate Attacks in M2M Communication Systems

A multilayered defense framework is employed to secure the system against adversarial threats:

- **Model-Level Security**: Anomaly filtering, input validation, regularization, and ensemble strategies improve ML robustness.
- **Network Hardening**: Secure protocols, port randomization, IDS/IPS, and rate limiting reduce attack surfaces.
- **Identity & Access Control**: Mutual authentication, JWT-based RBAC, and secure boot processes ensure only authorized communication.
- **Data Integrity**: Hashing, composite metrics, and time-series validation help detect tampering or spoofing attempts.
- **Model Lifecycle Security**: Techniques like model watermarking and edge-cloud segregation enhance trust and compartmentalization.
- **Monitoring & Auditing**: Real-time dashboards and audit logs provide operational visibility and traceability.
- **Hardware Protection**: Device fingerprinting and tamper-resistant modules prevent physical and firmware-level attacks.

These strategies collectively enhance the security posture of M2M systems against evolving threats.
